A GraphQL gateway built using NodeJs and Express-GraphQL. This app would act as an intermediary between consumer apps and conventional REST microservices built with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud. It fetches configuration details from a Spring Cloud config server and registers itself with Eureka and using the Feignjs and Feignjs-Request dependencies, makes calls to decoupled services.
